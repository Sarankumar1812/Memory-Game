# Memory Game

A simple and fun memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves flipping cards to find matching pairs while enhancing concentration and memory skills. The layout is responsive, and a win animation is triggered when all pairs are matched!

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Card Flipping**: Smooth 3D flip animation.
- **Match Detection**: Cards change color when matched.
- **Win Animation**: A congratulatory animation when the game is won.
- **Restart Functionality**: Easily restart the game at any time.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for the cards and game layout.
- **JavaScript (DOM manipulation)**: Game logic, including card flipping, matching, shuffling, and restarting.

## How to Play

1. Click on a card to flip it.
2. Try to find the matching card by flipping another one.
3. If the cards match, they will change color and stay flipped.
4. If the cards don't match, they will flip back over.
5. The game ends when all cards have been matched.
